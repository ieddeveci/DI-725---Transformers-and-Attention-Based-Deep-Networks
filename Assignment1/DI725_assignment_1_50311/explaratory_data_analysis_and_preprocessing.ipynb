    "This preprocessing approach focuses on cleaning and structuring the text to highlight relevant customer feedback while removing noise. It standardizes the content by lowercasing the text, which is a standard practice in NLP to reduce variations due to case sensitivity. The filtration ensures that the analysis remains focused on the customer's sentiments, which are the primary target for sentiment analysis. Removing text within square brackets and parentheses eliminates non-conversational elements (for example, agent's side interactions) that could distract from the emotional tone. Excluding order numbers removes irrelevant details that do not contribute to sentiment, such as logistical information. In conclusion, this preprocessing method isolates the customer’s expressed emotions, making the sentiment signal clearer and enhancing the accuracy of the sentiment analysis."
